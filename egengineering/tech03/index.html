<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Electrical Impedance Tomography&nbsp;</b>
- produces three-dimensional images of buried objects.&nbsp; Utilizes measurements
of resistivity, conductivity and “induced polarization” to distinguish
material differences.&nbsp; System is nonintrusive and is immune to magnetic
interferences, which hamper current geo-physical technologies.&nbsp; Current
applications include UXO location, UST location, petroleum storage facility
monitoring, landfill investigation, and archeological investigation.&nbsp;
US Navy interested in tactical applications.&nbsp; Access through LLNL</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Excitation of Mass tomography</b> –
produces two-dimensional images of breaches in non-conductive surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Imaging software renders image of electrical field passing through breach.&nbsp;
Suitable for landfill liners and caps and plastic piping.&nbsp;&nbsp; May
be applicable to metal piping.&nbsp;&nbsp; Produces exact leak locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Best available technology provides “proximity” to leak.&nbsp; Applications
include landfill geomembrane integrity verification, PVC pipe leak detection,
and reservoir integrity verification.&nbsp; Access through LLNL</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Pulse laser for surface contamination
removal</b> – laser emits light pulses that generate a plasma at the interface
between a surface and the contamination (e.g. paint, epoxy, radiological).&nbsp;
System has been used by the DOE to remove fixed radiological contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Surface temperature is less than 140F mitigating vapor emissions.&nbsp;
Suitable for clean removal of surface contamination with no damage to the
substructure.&nbsp; No additional waste stream from abrasive blast material
(e.g. CO2, water, sand, slag).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access through LLNL</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Chemical weapon decontamination spray</b>
– The oxygenated gel is able to destroy all known biological and chemical
agents.&nbsp; The applied gel dries to a benign powder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Primarily
designed for clean up of WMD could be suitable for medical waste treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Access through LLNL.&nbsp; Advertised in the CBD.</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Groundwater modeling tools</b> - Highly
detailed computer transport models enhanced by DOE’s research data.&nbsp;
Especially suited for radiological contamination.&nbsp; Suitable for modeling
of complex groundwater contamination and mitigation projects.&nbsp; LLNL
currently provides this service to municipalities (Orange County for El
Torro NAS) nationwide.&nbsp; Access through LLNL.</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>MTBE microbial remediation process</b>
– Mass generation of MTBE specific microbe.&nbsp; Employed in bio-air filters
or pumped into groundwater as vertical gradient barriers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
application of a target specific microbe focuses effort on mitigating contamination
rather than applying food to collocated microbes.&nbsp; Initial field tests
have been able to reach non-detect.&nbsp; Private company developed air
percolation process currently being evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp; LLNL inconjunction
with UC Davis to offer licenses for the microbe and the growth process.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;<b>Explosives</b> – Recently de-classified
energetic compounds providing more energy/workability, cost savings or
environmental safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; Potential application to shipscrapping
or general de-construction.&nbsp; Access through LLNL.&nbsp;</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Thermal UXO destruction</b> – The “Fire
Razor” is a combustion compound that burns at 4000K.&nbsp; More cost effective
than C-4.&nbsp; UXO destruction application currently licensed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thimble size package burns through shell/mine casing and ignites energetic
material.&nbsp; Applications for shipscrapping and general de-construction.&nbsp;
Access through SAIC.</font>
<p><img SRC="diamond.gif" height=17 width=17>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Plasma disintegration waste disposal
process</b> – Plasma furnace breaks down all compounds into elemental state.&nbsp;
Electromagnetic fields separate the elemental effluent.&nbsp; Able to process
hazardous and radioactive waste streams. Effluent separation process not
functioning.&nbsp; Large fabrication cost.&nbsp;</font></center>
