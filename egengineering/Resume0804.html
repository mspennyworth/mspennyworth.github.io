ammunition.</li>

<li>
Engineer in charge of Grand Canyon radiological survey team.&nbsp; Successfully
lead a four person team 1600ft. down the face of the Grand Canyon to characterize
the extent of radiological contamination from a DOE mine.&nbsp; Continuing
to propose innovative methods to mitigate site to include: silent demolition
of mine structures with “FireRazor” and electro – explosives and LLNL developed
computer monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<b>Multiple Projects, Strategic Initiatives Naval Environmental Detachment,
Deputy Director. </b>Projects included:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Organized and was the project engineer in charge of a tomographic research
project. Using Electrical Impedance Tomography, Naval Environmental Detachment
personnel, under the direction of the Geophysics Department at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, have produced three-dimensional images of
unexploded ordnance. The focus of the project is to attempt to obtain images
under reinforced concrete buildings with resolution of a quality to confirm
the presence or absence of ordnance items. The EIT system has been used
in commercial applications by EGEngineering.</li>

<li>
Prepared a feasibility study for the application of “Dynamic Steam Stripping”
at a petroleum-contaminated site at Mare Island. The DSS process, developed
at LLNL, uses injected steam, oxidation agents, and ERT to in-situ mitigate
the petroleum contaminants.&nbsp;</li>
